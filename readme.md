Hey! This is the first fullstack app I started to build, I did it with EJS which was cool in the beggining I quickly realised that EJS is outdated.
So I stopped working on this project and I focused on learning React instead. I still did learn a lot - also my css skills were pretty poor so it got me motivated to learn Tailwind
I didn't stop with backend stuff though I am just more focused on REST api's now. This project will be here but I am not planning to work on it, it is something to reflect my progress on.
